The IoTDraw provides a DSL, named as SoaML4IoT, specifically tailored for designing and simulating SOA-based IoT applications. The DSL was built on the Service oriented architecture Modeling Language (SoaML), an Object Management Group (OMG) standard for designing SOA solutions.

The IoTDraw with all its artifacts is a result of a Doctoral Thesis.
